            <p>We use precision and accuracy when eliminating enemies. We take our time and study the movements of our enemies before eliminating them. We plan our moves and roles before studying our enemies. We train and practice before we plan. We sprayed before we trained. We were brave before we were good. We are a team above all else, we look after our mates,  and execute every move accordingly. We are Don't Aim. The best of the worst, the worst of the best, the middle area between Silver and Legendary. We are mates, in a real game and in real life, communication is everything, practice is key, and strategies are our expertise. The leader is you, build you own path into the dirt, create and maintain a balance of movements, accuracy, and communication always.</p>
            <p><b>We are Don't Aim, and we know how to do things wrong. That's how we remember to do things right.</b></p>
