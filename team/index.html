            <p><b>Every group has to have its members. Here are ours.</b></p>
            <h2>The leader of it all, SprAy.</h2>
            <p>He's the creator, not the leader. He tries to win the game for the team, no matter the cost.</p>
            <h2>DuMbAZZ Dev</h2>
            <p>He may not be the best, but he always catches the best flanks and ambush spots. He usually has a good eye and great attention to detail. We don't know how he does it.</p> <!--And who tf plays Fortnite-->
            <h2>Special Region</h2>
            <p>Though his name may be funny, his gameplay is not. He compensates recoil well, and has close attention to enemy sounds, which means it's hard to outrun him. It's also hard to stick a firefight with him. I'd hate to 1v1 him, I'd never win.</p>
            <h2>MarshmelloSUCKS</h2>
            <p>Ah yes, the creator of this site. Eh, not the very best. However, he is good enough if you need a Terrorist sniper in Cobblestone. He might act a little retarded at times, but not "OWO NUZZLE ME AND FULFIL MY FURRY DREAMS UWU" retarded. More "missing shots" retarded. And he's got a soundboard to keep the team entertained in VC. (He's on <a href="https://twitch.tv/fcm_on_twitch">Twitch</a>, too. And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdNyejvw4XzTfvdCETOf_xw">YouTube</a>. And <a href="https://twitter.com/IowanEASFan">Twitter</a>.)</p>
            <h2>raWr</h2>
            <p>He may not have the best view while shit is going down, but he still manages to land his shots. He has the most amazing shot placement, usually landing headshots. He clears the enemies out quickly. He often goes "lonewolf" but still comes out on top, and comes to the rescue when we need him.</p>
            <h2>The Noble Army leader, NobleDefeat.</h2>
            <p><font color="white">He has cool skills with different types of weapons, he always keeps the team informed with enemy activity as he sees them, he's a team player, and always goes ahead of the team to keep them alive and well. He donates weapons if we need them. He has a great aim on targets from yards away, usually he has the best accuracy, and he drops them before we even get eyes on. Check out his <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/nobledefeat">Twitch</a> and become a part of the Noble Army today.</font></p>
