          <h2>Big Update Coming, Including New Join Requirements</h2>
          <p><i><sup>Posted Nov. 23 @ 13:16 PM CDT by SprAy</sup></i></p>
          <p>New Google Sites plans, new description, new Github site, new era for the Don't Aim team.
So while I was gone I was thinking a little about updating the team. I made a fresh new description that makes sense, and updated some information in the Google Site. Mello made a new Github site for people wanting to get a basic view of the site relatively quick. New members must have a friend associated wiith the team, join the Discord, and have a Steam Level of at least 2 to be accepted into the team.</p>
          <p>If any VAC bans arise just explain your situation, we'll get back to you on allowing you to stay in the team.</p>
          <p>We prefer new members to have Prime, although it is not a requirement.</p>
          <p>I'll be sure to check new member requests a bit more often, sorry to those of you I kept on a wait.</p>
